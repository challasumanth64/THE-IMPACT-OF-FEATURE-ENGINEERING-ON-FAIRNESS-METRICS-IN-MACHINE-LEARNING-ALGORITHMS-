Feature engineering plays a crucial role in shaping both the predictive performance and fairness of supervised learning models. Despite significant advancements in machine learning, systematic studies on how different feature engineering techniques impact fairness across various algorithms remain sparse. This research aims to investigate the relationship between feature engineering methods, such as feature discovery, feature scaling, and Binning, and their effect on fairness metrics like demographic parity, equalized odds. Using datasets that include sensitive attributes such as race, gender, and age, we will analyze the trade-offs between fairness and accuracy for multiple supervised learning models, including linear models, decision trees , logistic regression, and naive bayes. By systematically applying fairness metrics and bias mitigation techniques, we seek to propose guidelines for selecting feature engineering methods that promote fairness without sacrificing predictive accuracy. The findings of this research will help machine learning practitioners make informed decisions to mitigate bias and ensure equitable outcomes.
